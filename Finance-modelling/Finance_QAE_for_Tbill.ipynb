    "Based on Woener and Egger, 2018: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06893 \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we implement the calculation of the expectation value of a US Treasury bill. The zero coupon T-bill has a face value $V_F$ and is discounted at an interest rate $r$.  We want to calculate the value at a later time step given that there is a $p$ probability that the interest is constant, and $1-p$ probability that the interest rises to $r+\\delta r$. Therefore the T-bill has a value of\n",
    "<div class='math'>\n",
    "            \\begin{equation}\n",
    "            V = \\dfrac{(1-p)V_F}{1+r+\\delta r} + \\dfrac{pV_F}{1+r} = (1-p)V_{\\text{low}} + pV_\\text{high}.\n",
    "            \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We set $p = 30\\%$. The values for $V$ need to be mapped to qubits. In this simplified demonstration in order to use only one qubit for the distribution of $V$, we map $ V_\\text{low} = 0\\: \\$ $ and $ V_\\text{high} = 1\\: \\$ $. These correspond to the states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, respectively.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We use Quantum Amplitude Estimation to calculate the value of the T-bill. QAE is build from four components:\n",
    "- initial superposition of evaluation qubits with Hadamard gates\n",
    "- an $A$ gate that encodes the distribution of the possible outcomes for $V$ with corresponding probabilities and the objective function\n",
    "- a $Q$ gate based on $A$ and the number of evaluation qubits\n",
    "-  an inverse Quantum Fourier Transform.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In our simple case the $A$ gate is defined as $A =R_y(\\theta)$, where $\\theta = 2\\sin^{-1}(\\sqrt{p})$, i.e. it's merely a rotation around the y-axis parametrized by the probability $p$. Therefore it acts as $A|0\\rangle = \\sqrt{1-p}|0\\rangle + \\sqrt{p}|1\\rangle$, and respresents both the uncertainty distribution and the objective of our algorithm. Another gate needed is the amplitude estimation operator $Q$. Again, for us it simplifies to $Q = AZA^{\\dagger}Z = R_y(2\\theta)$. Powers of this gate are controllably applied $m$ times to the objective qubit, where $m$ is the number of evaluation qubits. These qubits are responsible for the accuracy and resolution of the estimate. The controlled gates are of form $ Q^{2^j} = R_y(2^{j+1}\\theta)$, where $j \\in \\{0,\\ldots,m-1\\}$.\n",
